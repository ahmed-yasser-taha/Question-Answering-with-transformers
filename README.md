# ðŸ§  Multi-Model Question Answering System

This project is a **Question Answering (QA) web application** built with **Streamlit** and **Hugging Face Transformers**. It allows users to input a text paragraph (context) and ask multiple questions about it. The system provides answers using several pre-trained transformer models.

## Features

- **Multi-model support:** Choose from DistilBERT, BERT, RoBERTa, or ALBERT.
- **Chat-like history:** Ask multiple questions and see all answers in a conversation-style layout.
- **Confidence scores:** Each answer comes with a model confidence percentage.
- **Interactive UI:** Clean and responsive Streamlit interface.

## How it Works

1. **Load a pre-trained model:** The selected transformer model is loaded using Hugging Face pipelines.
2. **Input context and questions:** Users enter a text paragraph and ask questions.
3. **Generate answers:** The model predicts the answer span in the context.
4. **Display results:** Answers and confidence scores are displayed in a chat-style interface.
